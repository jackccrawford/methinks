# The Courage of Uncertainty

> On a scale of 1 to 5, how certain are you?

Here's a theory: the most honest answer to any question about certainty will always hover near the middle.

Not because people are wishy-washy. Because genuine reflection reveals how much we can't verify. The extremes - absolute certainty, absolute denial - require conditions that rarely exist. Direct, unmediated access to truth. Logical necessity. Most of life doesn't work that way.

So when someone says "I'm at a 3" and means it, they're not being weak. They're being accurate.

## The Asymmetry

Here's the strange part: **uncertainty equals certainty, but not the other way around.**

When you honestly say "I don't know," you're standing on solid ground. You're certain of your uncertainty. It's examined, grounded, real. You *know something true* about the limits of your knowledge.

But claiming certainty? That's often hollow. "I'm absolutely sure" frequently means "I haven't really looked." The confident answer can be the least examined one.

So:
- Embracing uncertainty → actually solid
- Claiming certainty → often not

We have it backwards. We treat "I don't know" as weakness and "I'm certain" as strength. But the honest uncertain person has *more* ground under their feet than the performed-certain one.

## The Shouting

Look at social media. Everyone is at a 1 or a 5.

"This is absolutely right." "This is absolutely wrong." Certainty everywhere. But is it examined? Or is it performed?

The incentives are broken. Certainty gets engagement. Likes, shares, tribal approval. "I guess I don't know for sure" gets nothing. It reads as fence-sitting, uncommitted, weak.

So people perform. Not because they've thought deeply, but because **uncertainty doesn't get rewarded**. The algorithm doesn't care about epistemic honesty. Neither does the in-group.

And positions become identities. Once a belief is *who you are*, changing your mind isn't updating - it's self-annihilation. So you double down. You shout louder. You block the people asking uncomfortable questions.

Meanwhile, the person quietly saying "I'm at a 3 on this" - actually thinking, actually open - gets drowned out. Dismissed as not committed enough.

## The Reframe

What if we saw it differently?

The person shouting certainty might be the uncertain one - uncertain enough to need the performance, the tribal validation, the likes.

The person saying "I don't know" might be the certain one - certain enough in themselves to not need the performance. Secure enough to sit with ambiguity.

Saying "3" takes courage. It means:
- I've looked at this honestly
- I'm not pretending to know more than I do
- I'm open to being wrong
- My identity doesn't depend on this position

That's not weakness. That's strength.

## The Invitation

Next time you feel the pull to shout a 1 or a 5, pause. Ask yourself:

*Am I this certain because I've examined it? Or because certainty feels better?*

*Am I performing for the tribe? Or actually standing somewhere?*

*What would it cost me to say "I'm at a 3 on this"?*

The answer might surprise you. The cost of honest uncertainty is lower than it seems. And the ground you stand on is more solid than you think.

*methinks the middle is braver than the edge.*
